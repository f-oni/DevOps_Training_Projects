# Error Handling in Shell Scripting

Error handling involves anticipating and managing errors that may occur during script execution.
It prevents script failure and ensures graceful execution. The following methods can be employed to handle errors effectively:

1. Identify potential errors: Anticipate sources of error such as input validation, command execution, and file operations. Potential impact of each of the sources should be understood.
2. Use conditional statement: Conditional statements (if,elif,else) should be employed to check for error conditions and respond accordingly. checking the exit status ($?) of the most recently executed command and taking appropriate actions is essential.
3. Informative Messages: Descriptive error messages should be provided. The messages should clearly state what went wrong and how the issues could be resolved
   
Effectively handling errors in shell scripting is a vital skill for system administrators.
