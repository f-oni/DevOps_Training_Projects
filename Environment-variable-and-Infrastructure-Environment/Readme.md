# Environment Variables and Infrastructure Environment

The project delve into the meaning of two basic scripting concepts. The environment variables and infrastructure environment. Some insights into the differences and use cases were given thorough consideration.

## Environment Variables

Environment variables in Bash scripts are special variables that hold information accessible by the shell and any child processes it spawns. They are very important for creating flexible and adaptable scripts, as they allow for dynamic configuration and data sharing without hardcoding values directly into the script. They are key-value pair used in scripts or computer codes to manage configuration values and control software behaviour dynamically.

## Infrastructure Environment

The infrastructure environment encompasses the underlying hardware, software, and networking resources that support the development, testing, deployment, and operation of applications. It makes it possible for software to be efficiently built, tested, and delivered to users.

# Relationship 

Similar infrastructure can be set up for different purposes. some set up could be for development, testing or production. Those are the use cases of infrastructure environment. In each of the environments, however, environment variables can be set to hold configuration values for the application.
