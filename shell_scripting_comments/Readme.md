# Linux Shell Scripting (Comments)

The project is about proper use of comments in scripting. comments are lines that are ignored by the interpreter. Comments provide addition information about the code to other developers and even the its author. It helps to improve code quality, maintenability, and readability.The # symbol is used to preceed any line to be commented out in Bash scripting. There can be a single line comment or multi-line. Comments can also come after a command. 

The *vim* text editor was used for the project. A script was created and the following lines of code were entered into the script

#!/bin/bash

#This is a single line comment in bash

echo "Hello, you are learning Bash scripting on DAREY.IO" # This is also a comment, following a command.

#Multi line comments.

#This is another way to create

#a multi-line comment. Each line is

#prefixed with a # symbol.

echo "Here is an actual code that gets executed"

The script was saved by using the **:wq** combination on the keyboard after exiting the insert mode with the esc key.
It was run in the terminal with the command ./commenting.sh.
The output shows that all the lines prefixed by the # symbol were ignored.

## Conclusion
Comments are valuable in scripting as they can provide useful information about the code to other developers and even the author of the code much later.
