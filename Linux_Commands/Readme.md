## Working with Directories

The command **mkdir** was used to create directory. The first directory to be created in the root directory. The command **mkdir /root/example** was used to create the file but it failed due to permission denied error. To mitigate that, the following command was used instead **sudo mkdir /root/example**. It was successfully created.
